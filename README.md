## Description

Provide a short description explaining the what, why, and how of your project. Use the following questions as a guide:

- What was your motivation? To learn the basics of HTML, CSS, Java and Git.
- Why did you build this project? (Note: the answer is not "Because it was a homework assignment.") To breifly demonstrate how HTML, CSS, JavaScript and Git are intertwined together when building a webpage from the ground up. 
- What problem does it solve? It is a digestable learning module that has shown me that I am capable of creating something that previously I thought was impossible. 
- What did you learn? I learned basic formatting of HTML. How the "Head" is where configuration of the page and other metadate is stored. The "Body" is where writing that the end user will see is created. CSS is used to stylize the page. The JavaScript is the main coding of the webpage, creating loops and other interactive functions on the page. Learned what an "Array" of data is and how they are used.
